CRISPR
originally
employed
knock
target
genes
various
cell
types
organisms,
modifications
various
enzymes
have
extended
CRISPR
selectively
activate/repress
target
genes,
purify
specific
regions
DNA,
image
live
cells,
precisely
edit
RNA.
Furthermore,
ease
generating
gRNAs
makes
CRISPR
most
scalable
genome
editing
technologies.
This
advantage
makes
CRISPR
perfect
genome-wide
screens.
