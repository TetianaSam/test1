CRISPR was originally employed to knock out target genes in various cell types an
 organisms, but modifications to various Cas enzymes have extended CRISPR to selectively activate/repress
 target genes, purify specific regions of DNA, image DNA in live cells, and precisely edit DNA and RNA. Furthermore, the ease of generating gRNAs makes CRISPR
one of the most scalable genome editing technologies. This advantage makes CRISPR perfect for genome-wide screens.
